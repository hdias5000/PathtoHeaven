# PathToHeaven

The android app Path to Heaven was built as a part of the Semester long IT Project, COMP30022, in an effort to help Elderly People get from one location to another while receiving any help in case they get lost or walk into some trouble.

To create this application our team has interviewed the Target Market(Elderly People) and found out exactly the type of product they would need.

Our product allows two types of users to access this application:
Elderly People: The target user base of our app. This app is intended to help them.
Helpers: These are the users who are supposed to help the Elderly People.
